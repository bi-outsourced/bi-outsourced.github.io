Agency Jekyll theme
====================

Agency theme based on [Agency bootstrap theme ](https://startbootstrap.com/template-overviews/agency/)

# How to use

###Portfolio

[NOTE:] There's a Modal functionality which is currently not used. In the original theme the modals were used for Portfolio, I'm not using the modals at the moment and renamed the Portfolio to Technology. In
the future a Portfolio section might be added.

Portfolio projects are in '/_posts'

Images are in '/img/portfolio'

###About

Images are in '/img/about/'

###Team

Team members and info are in '_config.yml'

Images are in '/img/team/'
